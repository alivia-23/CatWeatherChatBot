This project is as part of my Coursera Building Serverless Application in AWS course project.
This application is hosted to acquire knowledge and gain hands on learning on AWS platform by following the coursera learning lecture and demo project.

# Static Website

The goal of this website is to support the learning of the Building Serverless Applications course.


Thought the lab you may need to edit a config file. Simpy replace the `null` with with your content.

For example inside config.json you would replace

```JavaScript
		var G_API_GATEWAY_URL_STR = null;
```

with

```JavaScript

		var G_API_GATEWAY_URL_STR = "https://eois2fhvse.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/test"
```
according to the excercise guide.


Then push that back up to the root of the website.

Eveything else you need to know about this excercise is in the excercise guide.
